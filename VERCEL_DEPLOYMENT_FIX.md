# Vercel Deployment Configuration Update

## Problem
Previously, when deploying the application to Vercel at `https://route-roan.vercel.app`, WebSocket connections were failing because:
1. Vercel is a static hosting platform that doesn't support traditional WebSocket servers
2. The application was trying to connect to `wss://route-roan.vercel.app/socket.io/` which doesn't exist
3. This caused connection errors and prevented the application from functioning properly

## Solution
Updated the application to attempt real WebSocket connections even on Vercel deployments. The application will now:
1. Attempt to connect to WebSocket servers on Vercel deployments
2. Fall back to standard connection error handling if the connection fails
3. No longer automatically switch to "Demo Mode" for Vercel deployments

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Backend Configuration
File: [web/js/utils/BackendConfig.js](file:///Users/hh/tao/route/web/js/utils/BackendConfig.js)

- Removed automatic demo mode detection for Vercel deployments
- Updated `shouldUseDemoMode()` method to always return false
- Vercel deployments now use the same domain as the frontend for backend connections

### 2. Updated WebSocket Client
File: [web/js/utils/WebSocketClient.js](file:///Users/hh/tao/route/web/js/utils/WebSocketClient.js)

- Removed Vercel deployment check that prevented WebSocket connections
- WebSocket connections will now be attempted on all deployments
- Connection errors will be handled through standard error handling

### 3. Updated Main Application
File: [web/js/main.js](file:///Users/hh/tao/route/web/js/main.js)

- Removed Vercel deployment check in connection logic
- Removed automatic demo mode setup for Vercel deployments
- Connection errors will be handled through standard error handling

### 4. Updated Real AI Interface
File: [web/js/real-ai-interface.js](file:///Users/hh/tao/route/web/js/real-ai-interface.js)

- Removed Vercel deployment check in connection logic
- Removed automatic demo mode setup for Vercel deployments
- Connection errors will be handled through standard error handling

## How It Works

### Environment Detection
1. **Localhost Development**: Connects to `http://localhost:8080` for WebSocket connections
2. **Vercel Deployments**: Attempts to connect to WebSocket on the same domain as the frontend
3. **Other Production Environments**: Connects to the backend on the same domain as the frontend

### Connection Handling
1. **Successful Connections**: Full real-time functionality with actual AI agents
2. **Connection Failures**: Standard error handling with user notifications
3. **No Automatic Demo Mode**: Vercel deployments no longer automatically switch to demo mode

## Benefits

1. **Real Data on Vercel**: Vercel deployments can now use real AI data when a backend is available
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Same connection logic across all deployment environments
3. **Clear Error Handling**: Connection failures are handled consistently
4. **No Code Changes**: Same codebase works in all environments
5. **Easy Maintenance**: Simplified connection logic

## Usage

The application now:
- When running on localhost:3000, connects to the backend on localhost:8080
- When deployed to Vercel, attempts to connect to the backend on the same domain
- When deployed to other domains, connects to the backend on the same domain

If a backend server is running and accessible, the application will use real data. If not, standard connection error handling will apply.
