# Vercel Deployment Fix for WebSocket Connections

## Problem
When deploying the application to Vercel at `https://route-roan.vercel.app`, WebSocket connections were failing because:
1. Vercel is a static hosting platform that doesn't support traditional WebSocket servers
2. The application was trying to connect to `wss://route-roan.vercel.app/socket.io/` which doesn't exist
3. This caused connection errors and prevented the application from functioning properly

## Solution
Implemented a smart detection system that automatically switches to "Demo Mode" when deployed to Vercel, while maintaining full functionality in development and other production environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Backend Configuration
File: [web/js/utils/BackendConfig.js](file:///Users/hh/tao/route/web/js/utils/BackendConfig.js)

- Added detection for Vercel deployments using `window.location.hostname.includes('vercel.app')`
- Added `shouldUseDemoMode()` method to determine when to use demo mode
- Updated URL determination logic for different environments

### 2. Updated WebSocket Client
File: [web/js/utils/WebSocketClient.js](file:///Users/hh/tao/route/web/js/utils/WebSocketClient.js)

- Added demo mode detection and handling
- In demo mode, the client doesn't attempt WebSocket connections
- All send/receive operations are gracefully handled without actual network calls
- Added `isDemoMode` property to check current mode

### 3. Updated Main Application
File: [web/js/main.js](file:///Users/hh/tao/route/web/js/main.js)

- Added demo mode setup with periodic simulated data updates
- Created realistic demo agent data to show in the UI
- Added visual notifications when demo mode is active
- Implemented simulated task chain updates

### 4. Updated Real AI Interface
File: [web/js/real-ai-interface.js](file:///Users/hh/tao/route/web/js/real-ai-interface.js)

- Added demo mode handling for the Real AI interface
- Created demo system status data
- Updated UI to show "Demo Mode Active" status
- Added periodic demo data updates

### 5. Updated CSS Styling
File: [web/css/real-ai.css](file:///Users/hh/tao/route/web/css/real-ai.css)

- Added styling for demo mode status indicators
- Added styling for demo mode notifications

## How It Works

### Environment Detection
1. **Localhost Development**: Connects to `http://localhost:8080` for WebSocket connections
2. **Vercel Deployments**: Automatically switches to demo mode with simulated data
3. **Other Production Environments**: Connects to the same domain as the frontend

### Demo Mode Features
1. **No WebSocket Connections**: Eliminates connection errors on platforms that don't support WebSockets
2. **Simulated Data**: Generates realistic demo data for agents, tasks, and system metrics
3. **Periodic Updates**: Simulates real-time updates with changing data
4. **Visual Indicators**: Clearly shows when the application is in demo mode
5. **Full UI Functionality**: All visualizations and interactions work with demo data

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Deployment**: Works on Vercel without connection errors
2. **Maintains Functionality**: Users can still see and interact with the application
3. **Clear Communication**: Users understand they're seeing demo data
4. **No Code Changes**: Same codebase works in all environments
5. **Easy Maintenance**: Centralized detection logic

## Usage

The application now automatically:
- When running on localhost:3000, connects to the backend on localhost:8080
- When deployed to Vercel, switches to demo mode with simulated data
- When deployed to other domains, connects to the backend on the same domain

This allows the same codebase to work in development, Vercel deployments, and traditional server deployments without modification.
