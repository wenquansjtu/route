# WebSocket Transport Error Fixes

## Problem
The WebSocket connections were experiencing "transport error" disconnections, causing clients to lose connection to the server unexpectedly.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Transport Configuration Mismatch**: 
   - Server had `allowUpgrades: false` while client was trying to upgrade connections
   - Transport order was inconsistent between client and server

2. **Ping/Pong Configuration Mismatch**:
   - Different ping intervals and timeouts between client and server

3. **Connection Stability Issues**:
   - No special handling for transport errors
   - Aggressive reconnection logic missing for transport-specific issues

## Fixes Implemented

### Server-Side Changes (`src/server-real-ai.js`)

1. **Updated Socket.IO Configuration**:
   ```javascript
   this.io = new SocketIOServer(this.server, {
     // ... other config
     transports: ["websocket", "polling"], // Try websocket first
     allowUpgrades: true, // Enable upgrades for stability
     pingTimeout: 60000,  // Match client settings
     pingInterval: 25000, // Match client settings
   });
   ```

2. **Enhanced Disconnection Handling**:
   - Added special handling for transport errors
   - Improved logging for debugging
   - Better cleanup of heartbeat intervals

### Client-Side Changes (`web/js/utils/WebSocketClient.js`)

1. **Updated Socket.IO Client Configuration**:
   ```javascript
   this.socket = io(url, {
     transports: ['websocket', 'polling'], // Match server order
     upgrade: true, // Enable upgrades
     pingInterval: 25000, // Match server
     pingTimeout: 60000,  // Match server
   });
   ```

2. **Enhanced Reconnection Logic**:
   - Special handling for transport errors with immediate reconnect
   - Better error logging and reporting
   - Improved heartbeat management

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Start the server: `npm run start`
2. Open `test-websocket-fixed.html` in a browser
3. Monitor the connection status

## Expected Results

- Significantly reduced transport errors
- More stable long-term connections
- Faster recovery from network interruptions
- Better error reporting and logging

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Network Monitoring**: Implement additional network monitoring to detect issues early
2. **Load Balancing**: For production deployments, consider load balancing to distribute connections
3. **Connection Limits**: Monitor and adjust connection limits based on server capacity
4. **Client-Side Improvements**: Add exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
